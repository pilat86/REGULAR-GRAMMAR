# REGULAR-GRAMMAR

**Assignments:**

***Mating call (1 point)***

*Penguins call for mating by beeping (making the sound π). The words of this language are in the form πππππππππ, where the number of individual π in a word is always divisible by three (which happens to be the exact value of the number π at the South Pole). An empty string is not a valid word.*

***Intellectual debates (2 points)***

*Penguin debates in educated society are characterized by the fact that they consist exclusively of the letters "k", "s" and "i" and contain at least one substring "ksi". (For example, the word ikiksiskis belongs to it, but kssisk does not.)*

***Beer conversation (3 points)***

*A little-known fact is that even at the South Pole, it is a favorite tradition of penguins to meet in the evening for a beer and discuss everything possible and impossible. Such a conversation consists exclusively of the characters "p", "i", "v" and "o". Coincidentally, however, the word beer means CENSORED in penguin language, which is why no penguin would dare to use it even in communication with his arch-enemy. Beer conversation therefore consists exclusively of words that do not contain beer as a subword. (For example, the valid word vipovipip translates to something like a feeling of mischievous joy at the fact that a publicly known personality or politician is stupider than you, whereas for an invalid vpivoip many people would slap you.) An empty string is also valid (silence sometimes pays for 1000 words ).*

***Sign language (1 point)***

*Part of the penguin language is even sign language! It consists of only two characters, namely “^” (fin up) and “v” (fin down). The words of this language are all even in length and never contain the same symbol twice in a row. (So ^v^v^v is a valid word, but v^^v is not.) An empty word is not valid.*

***Mathematics (3 points)***

*Since penguins really like the number π (=3), they only count with numbers that are divisible by three. So write a grammar that generates all (natural including zero) numbers in the decimal system that are divisible by three without a remainder. (Note that 0 is a valid number, but e.g. 003 is not!) If you want to simplify the marking somehow, always state it in the label. (Hint: a number is divisible by three if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by three.)*
